You are looking at a picture of a park. There are children playing soccer, a couple sitting on a bench eating ice cream, a man walking his dog, and a group of teenagers riding bicycle. Describe the scene.

- Sample Answer (Approximate 60 seconds)

In this picture, I can see a lively park scene.

On the left side, two children are playing soccer together, and they look very energetic and excited.

In the center, there is a couple sitting on a bench, sharing an ice cream cone, which makes the atmosphere feel warm and friendly.

On the right side, a man is walking his dog along the pathway, and the dog looks very happy.

In the background, I notice a group of teenagers riding bicycles, probably enjoying the sunny weather.

Overall, the scene gives me the impression of a peaceful and cheerful afternoon in the park, where people of all ages are having fun.

Example Task #4 Prompt:

You are looking at a picture of a park. There are children playing soccer, a couple sitting on a bench eating ice cream, a man walking his dog, and a group of teenagers riding bicycles. What do you think wil happen next?

- Sample Answer (Approximate 60 seconds)

I think the children who are playing soccer might continue their game for a while, but soon they could get tired and take a break.

The couple on the bench will probably finish their ice cream and then go for a short walk around the park.

The man walking his dog may stop to let his dog play on the grass, or he might run into someone he knows and have a chat.

As for the teenagers on their bicycles, I think they are likely to ride around the park a few more times and then leave together.

Overall, it seems like everyone will continue to enjoy the nice weather and spend more time relaxing in the park.

2. Example Task #3 Prompt:

Image Description: A bustling farmers' market. There are stalls with fresh fruits and vegetables, people are shopping, and a vendor is handing a bag of produce to a customer.

- Sample Answer:

In this image, we see a lively farmers' market. On the left side, there's a stall full of colorful fresh fruits and vegerables, and a vendor is handing a bag of produce to a customer who looks pleased with their purchase.

In the background, people are browsing the stalls, and you can see a variety of produce on display.

The atmosphere feels vibrant and cheerful, with people enjoying their time shopping for fresh, local produce.

- Task #4 Making predictions:

Same Image: The family is still at the farmers' market, and the vendor is handing over the produce.

- Sample Answer:

Given that the customer has just received their produce, I predict that they will soon head to the next stall or possibly finish their shopping.

The market seems busy, so it's likely that more people will continue to arrive and shop.

Overall, the market will stay lively for a while longer.
